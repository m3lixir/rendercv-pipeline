        description: Developed TDFF, a taint-driven firmware fuzzer that leverages dynamic taint analysis and fuzzing strategies to identify vulnerabilities in embedded system firmware. The research focuses on improving security testing for embedded devices, which traditionally lack the resources for advanced fuzzing techniques. The work demonstrates TDFF's effectiveness through several test cases, including simple and complex C programs.

        description: Co-authored a research paper proposing a proactive solution for autonomous vehicle platooning security through the use of Autonomous Vehicle contracts. The paper introduces the use of secure enclaves to enforce driving agreements in AV platoons, improving safety by restricting sudden braking or dangerous maneuvers. The feasibility of this system was demonstrated through a prototype implementation using Intel SGX enclaves and tested in real-world scenarios. The proposed solution minimizes risks from cyberattacks in AV platoons, with experimental results showing that vehicle autonomy can be safely restored within 1.5 seconds of an attack.
